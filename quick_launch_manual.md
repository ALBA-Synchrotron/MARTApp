# Quick Launch Manual

**MARTApp** is available in two flavors:

- X11-based, which provides basic X11 forwarding, allowing the user to natively use the application on their system.
- noVNC-based, which allows the user to use the application in their browser.

For both, Docker is required. It can be downloaded from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Once installed, open the application to verify that it works, and then we can proceed pulling MARTApp using your
system command line (distributed through [GitHub registry](https://github.com/orgs/ALBA-Synchrotron/packages/container/package/martapp)):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/alba-synchrotron/martapp:latest # or martapp:latest_novnc for the noVNC version
```

Then, to launch the application, the process is different depending on the chosen flavor.

## X11-based

To use X11, depending on the system, different previous steps are required:

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>
First, enable X11 forwarding:

```bash
xhost +local:docker
```

Finally, start the container:

```bash
docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
           -v "/tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix/" \
           -v "SOURCE:DESTINATION" \
           --gpus all \
           ghcr.io/alba-synchrotron/martapp:latest
```
- `-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY` allows us to access the display for the GUI.
- `-v "/tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix/"` allows us to forward X11.
- `-v "SOURCE:DESTINATION"` allows us to access SOURCE path (on our machine) as the path indicated in DESTINATION. For example, `-v "/homelocal/user/data/:/data"` will map `/homelocal/user/data/` to `/data` in the application interface.
- `--gpus all` enables the application to utilize the GPU during reconstruction, thereby improving performance. More information [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/resource_constraints/#gpu).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

Firstly, we need to install **XLaunch**. To do it, we need to install **VcXsrv Windows X Server**, which can be downloaded from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) (using default settings/installation). Then, open and set up **XLaunch**:

1. Select "Multiple windows".
2. Choose "Start no client".
3. Ensure "Clipboard" is checked to allow copying between Windows and the application.
4. Check "Native OpenGL".
5. Finish and keep it running.

Then, we need to know the IP of our computer. We can use `ipconfig`:
```bash
>> ipconfig
...
Adaptador de Ethernet Ethernet:
   Direcci√≥n IPv4. . . . . . . . . . . . . . : XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX # This is the IP of our computer
...
```

Finally, we can launch the application:
```bash
docker run -e DISPLAY=COMPUTER_IP \
           -v "/tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix/" \
           -v "SOURCE:DESTINATION" \
           --gpus all \
           ghcr.io/alba-synchrotron/martapp:latest
```

- `-e DISPLAY=COMPUTER_IP` allows us to access the display for the GUI. `COMPUTER_IP` must be our IP address, retrieved using `ipconfig`. For some cases, instead of using the IP, we can set `DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0`.
- `-v "/tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix/"` allows us to forward X11.
- `-v "SOURCE:DESTINATION"` allows us to access `SOURCE` path (on our machine) as the path indicated in `DESTINATION`. For example, `-v "C:\user\data\:/data"` will map `C:\user\data\` to `/data` in the application interface.
- `--gpus all` enables the application to utilize the GPU during reconstruction, thereby improving performance. More information [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/resource_constraints/#gpu).

<details>
<summary>macOS</summary>

First, we need to install **XQuartz**, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.xquartz.org/) or using the command line:
```bash
brew install --cask xquartz
```

After restarting MacOS, we should do the following using the command line:
```bash
# Open XQuartz
open -a XQuartz

# Enable "Allow connections from network clients" option in Preferences>Security

# Add localhost as an allowed source in order to share the screen
xhost + 127.0.0.1
```

Finally, we can launch the application:
```bash
docker run -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 \
           -v "/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix" \
           -v "SOURCE:DESTINATION" \
           ghcr.io/alba-synchrotron/martapp:latest
```
- `-e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0` allows us to access the display for the GUI.
- `-v "/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix"` allows us to forward X11.
- `-v "SOURCE:DESTINATION"` allows us to access `SOURCE` path (on our machine) as the path indicated in `DESTINATION`. For example, `-v "/homelocal/user/data/:/data"` will map `/homelocal/user/data/` to `/data` in the application interface.

Unfortunately, Docker does not allow for using GPUs other than NVIDIA ones, and then macOS machines cannot use GPU support. This may worsen the computing time required for reconstructions, but not their quality.

</details>

## noVNC-based


<details>
<summary>noVNC-based</summary>

We only need to launch the application:

```bash
docker run -p 5900:5900 -p 6080:6080 \
           -v "SOURCE:DESTINATION" \
           --gpus all \
           ghcr.io/alba-synchrotron/martapp:latest_novnc
```
- `-p 5900:5900 -p 6080:6080` allows port mapping between the Docker container and the system.
- `-v "SOURCE:DESTINATION"` allows us to access `SOURCE` path (on our machine) as the path indicated in `DESTINATION`. For example, `-v "/homelocal/user/data/:/data"` will map `/homelocal/user/data/` to `/data` in the application interface.
- `--gpus all` enables the application to utilize the GPU during reconstruction, thereby improving performance. More information [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/resource_constraints/#gpu).

The application will be automatically opened in your browser. If not, enter in http://localhost:6080/.

If the ports are already in use by other applications, change them (e.g, increasing by 1 the numbers), and if they are used by Docker (e.g., because the application has been incorrectly closed), the following can be done:
```bash
# Look for the Docker container ID
docker ps

# Kill the container
docker kill <CONTAINER_ID>

# Run the application again
```
