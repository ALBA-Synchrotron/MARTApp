# MARTApp

**MARTApp (Magnetic Analysis & Reconstruction of Tomographies App)** is a cross-platform application delevoped in BL09 MISTRAL for the analysis and vectorial reconstruction of magnetic tomographies adquired at the beamline (but not limited to it). 

In this repo you may find:

- [**User guide** to use MARTApp in/outside ALBA](./user_guide.pdf)
- **Technical Manual** for a better understanding of MARTApp (available soon)
- [**Quick Launch Manual** to launch the app outside ALBA](./quick_launch_manual.md)

## Do you have suggestions or have you found a bug?
If you have a suggestion of a feature that you would like to see included in the
application or something that could be improved, as well as in the case that you
found a bug, do not hesitate to open an issue using 
the Issues tab or to write an email to *jgsanchez (at) cells.es*.
