# About MARTApp's code

MARTApp is based on two python packages: `sdm-mistral`, which is the core and 
has the different used pipelines; and `martapp`, which only manages the application's front-end.

Currently, `sdm-mistral` is under re-implementation (the pipelines themself will remain the same), and the version here is just a fraction of the whole package. We are working on the publication of the full code and the published code here should only be used for illustrative purposes.

Please, do not hesitate to contact us if you need a fully working version of the code for further development.
